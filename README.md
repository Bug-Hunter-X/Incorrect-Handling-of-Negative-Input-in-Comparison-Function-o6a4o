# Incorrect Handling of Negative Input in Comparison Function
This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in a Python function that compares two numbers and returns the larger one. The bug lies in the function's failure to handle negative input values correctly.

## Bug Description
The `my_function` function is designed to return the larger of two input numbers. However, when provided with a negative number as an input, it fails to return the expected result.

## Bug Solution
The solution involves adding explicit error handling or input validation to correctly handle negative numbers.
